  <p>
    The groups mentioned are : I, II, III, ..., IX, X.
    <br>
    <br>
    1. After deteriming the experiment, the observation comes out to be the following:
  </p>
  <ul class="list"></ul>



  <p>
    2. When a dice is thrown by each group a mere 50 times, we can assume the no. of times '1' appeared as:
  </p>
  <p class="point2"></p>



  <p>
    3. Moving over to the next part, we'll find the data: a<sub>n</sub>/50 :
  </p>
  <p class="point3"></p>


  <p>
    4. We'll now find the probability of of 1 based on the groups: (a<sub>1</sub>/50) , (a<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>2</sub>)/100 and so on...
  </p>
  <p class="point4"></p>

  <p>
    5. We'll now find the probability of of 2 based on the groups: (b<sub>1</sub>/50) , (b<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>2</sub>)/100 and so on...
  </p>
  <p class="point5"></p>


  <p>
    6. We'll now find the probability of of 3 based on the groups: (c<sub>1</sub>/50) , (c<sub>1</sub> + c<sub>2</sub>)/100 and so on...
  </p>
  <p class="point6"></p>


  <p>
    7. We'll now find the probability of of 4 based on the groups: (d<sub>1</sub>/50) , (d<sub>1</sub> + d<sub>2</sub>)/100 and so on...
  </p>
  <p class="point7"></p>


  <p>
    8. We'll now find the probability of of 5 based on the groups: (e<sub>1</sub>/50) , (e<sub>1</sub> + e<sub>2</sub>)/100 and so on...
  </p>
  <p class="point8"></p>


  <p>
    9. We'll now find the probability of of 6 based on the groups: (f<sub>1</sub>/50) , (f<sub>1</sub> + f<sub>2</sub>)/100 and so on...
  </p>
  <p class="point9"></p>



  <p>
    10. Blah Blah and blah blah
  </p>
